Iâ€™m a product designer and developer from St. Louis, Missouri. I design, code, teach, and write in the ever evolving world of the web.

### Live to create, create to live

Iâ€™m a designer at heart. Rather than handing things off to a developer I saw the need to bring my ideas to fruition, and from that Iâ€™m what they call a unicorn ðŸ¦„.

I write, teach, and love learning all things web. While I specialize in UX/UI design Iâ€™m a man of many hats who has worked with mom and pop shops to fortune 500 corporations.
