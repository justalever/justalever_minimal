#### Past stuff

[LUXD: Learn User Experience Design](https://web-crunch.com/products/luxd-product) – My second book and digital product following the stairstep approach. It sold a decent amount of copies which were my first internet dollars made. A cool milestone.

[pro tumblr theming](https://web-crunch.com/products/ptt-product) – My first free digital book. I was building custom tumblr themes for bands I was in and our friends at the time. I took what I learned and made a guide on how to build a theme from scratch. From this book I made a [repo on Github](https://github.com/justalever/tumblrboilerplate) that got a lot of stars as a starting point for a basic tumblr theme.
