#### Successful past & present projects

[Web-Crunch.com](https://web-crunch.com) – I started this blog about 8 years ago. Been trying to grow it ever since. It plus a YouTube channel has grown the audience more than I ever thought was possible for someone like me.

[Hello Rails](https://hellorails.io) – A course that was born out of blogging and screencasting about the Ruby on Rails framework. I saw a need for those new to the framework to have a more approachable course. It's done about $40k to this date.

[LUXD: Learn User Experience Design](https://web-crunch.com/products/luxd-product) – My second book and digital product following the stairstep approach. It sold a decent amount of copies which were my first internet dollars made. A cool milestone.

[pro tumblr theming](https://web-crunch.com/products/ptt-product) – My first free digital product. I was building custom tumblr themes for bands I was in and our friends at the time. I took what I learned and made a guide on how to build a theme from scratch. From this book I made a [repo on Github](https://github.com/justalever/tumblrboilerplate) that got a lot of stars as a starting point for a basic tumblr theme.
