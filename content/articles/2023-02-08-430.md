I've been experimenting with waking at 4:30 A.M. to see if my productivity benefits. Throughout a typical day, I have too many distractions that have been pulling my attention away from some short-term and long-term goals.

This bio-hack could help. With kids in the picture, it's tough to balance work/family time, and ultimately this might be the best path even though I'm not a morning person.

I'm on day two, so we will see how this goes.

It's been about four days now. I slept in once, but the other days were early starts, and I like the extra hour or two to have uninterrupted time to plan and work. I may have to stick to this strategy. At this stage, I keep asking myself, "Could I  handle 3:30 A.M.?". Oh, dear...
