Over a decade ago, I lost my mother to cancer, which significantly changed my life.

Before that major event, my life was incredibly great. I was young, having fun, and had a wonderful family and parents that supported anything I wanted to do (fun fact: I once tried to be a professional guitarist).

In those trying times, I picked up a drinking habit to cope. When you're grieving, you turn anywhere for some relief; unfortunately, my family and I indulged quite a bit.

My family has historically bonded through drinking. I don't know why it is, but I often wish it wasn't the case. I think many families and friends do this, and it's wild how normal it is to put toxins into our bodies until we can't think straight.

All this is to say that I've struggled to quit alcohol for the past decade. I would always find a reason or excuse to pour another drink, but deep down, I hated the bad habit I'd formed. Some might call this alcholism, and I agree, but I've quit bad habits before, and I'm finally looking to do this.

Alcohol provides zero benefits to humans when you think about it. It's expensive, makes you feel and act wrong, and doesn't improve life. I've got a ways to go to be where I want. I struggle with energy, depression, anxiety, and the whole deck of cards, but most days, I try to be active, meditate, and be thankful for what I have. One day at a time, one foot in front of the other, one more rep, no matter the obstacle, I will keep going as it just gets better.
