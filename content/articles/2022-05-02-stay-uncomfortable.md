I think staying comfortable in life is essentially joining the rat race. If you don't continue to make hard decisions, grow, or take riskier chances you never truly outgrow where you are today. This can apply to relationships, learning, investing, health, and so much more.

In the past couple of years, I've made some bigger moves. Whether it's related to investments or careers I never looked back and thought they were bad decisions. In fact, because of those bold decisions, I surpassed my expectations in achieving some realm of success.

In the next few years, I hope to surprise myself even more. If I fail, I'll learn a lot and be able to make more educated chances in the future.

There is something to be said for taking a quantitative approach toward success. Trying many times to achieve a goal will likely result in an increased odds of reaching it.

Most of the time you don't come out on top but then there's that one home run that makes it all worthwhile.

Stay the course.
