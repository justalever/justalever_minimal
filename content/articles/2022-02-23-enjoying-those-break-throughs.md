Last night I had a rare opportunity to work late into the evening. The kids were in bed and I had the energy to dig in to a new project I'm working on.

Reflecting on that time now I realize I get very passionate about a project if I am excited to work on it at any point in a given day.

Even during normal working hours ideas keep flowing. I often jot down questions in need of answers or ideas for ways to perfect a given feature.

### Celebrate small wins

There's a point with new projects where you're still in discovery mode.

I broke ground knowing I wanted to build something new but really had no map or path to follow. This is both painful and exciting and why I'm a builder.

It feels like laying the tracks of a railroad while an engine is waiting patiently behind to inch forward.

Sometimes I hit a hurdle and the train won't budge and other times, like last night, I reach a big milestone that feels like a break through. Celebrating those small wins and having that excitment is what keeps me building.

Even if no one cares or uses whatever it is I'm building I can look back and know I didn't just say I was going to do something. I executed. That's often the hardest part with doing anything worthwhile.
