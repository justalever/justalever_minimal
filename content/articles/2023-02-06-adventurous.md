> Adventures only happen to the adventurous

This line hit me hard recently. I read it inside the book called  "[The Third Door](https://thirddoorbook.com/)."

I find it funny that taking risks is the only way to grow outside the box society tells us to live within, but there's so much truth to it. Most people want to be guided or told what to do because it's the easy path.

By being adventurous, people are exposed to more people and opportunities, both good and bad, and as a result, the outcome is usually a success.
