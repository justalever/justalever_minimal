Some new stuff I'm considering focusing on.

ğŸ’¡ Simple email capture API similar to Netlify forms but unbundled.

ğŸ’¡ Direct booking tools for Airbnb hosts (I am one).

ğŸ’¡ More tools and courses for the Ruby on Rails community.

ğŸ’¡ A job board that only features companies who share salary ranges.

ğŸ’¡ Fitness coach website builder with subscription model built in.

ğŸ’¡ Product design newsletter

ğŸ’¡ A designer index. Search for and hire designers.

ğŸ’¡ Something to help folks home school more easily.

ğŸ’¡ Headless newsletter platform - API and CLI driven. Bring your own templates and content. Market to developers/techie folk.
