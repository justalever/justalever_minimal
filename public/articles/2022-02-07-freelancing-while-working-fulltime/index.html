    </header><p>For as long as I&rsquo;ve been a designer, freelancing has been a means to earn income. I work full-time as a product designer right now. It pays the bills but there&rsquo;s always room for income.</p>
<p>I fund a family of four, two K9s, and a couple of mortgages–one being a rental property. Any little bit helps as expenses rise.</p>
<p>Long-term, my goal is to eliminate unnecessary expenses and live below our means while adding more assets to the mix. Add in saving aggressively and investing in my children&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Freelancing helps get me there when the going gets tough. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a true grind to do it.</p>
<h3 id="trading-time-for-money">Trading time for money</h3>
<p>I hate trading time for money. Those that have amassed wealth do exactly the opposite. Their money buys them time and pays them while doing so.</p>
<p>The value of helping others with something I&rsquo;m good at and passionate about is attractive no doubt. So I guess it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>The time for money debate has always bugged me. Outside of freelancing and working full-time I&rsquo;ve built software products. I&rsquo;ve tried and failed many times to make those produce money without input.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely tough. To see those successfully doing it makes those failures harder to swallow.</p>
<p>Hopefully, my time is ahead of me. I have even less availability than years ago thanks to family and other responsibilities. Any effort put towards it needs to be worth it.</p>
<p>Freelancing helps me add more assets to my portfolio and save money. What it <strong>does not</strong> do is give me time back to live my life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow.</p>
