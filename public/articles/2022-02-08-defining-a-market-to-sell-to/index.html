    </header><p>I make web development tutorial content for a site called <a href="https:/web-crunch.com">web-crunch.com</a>. That content gets distributed to <a href="https://youtube.com/c/webcrunch">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>For a year or two I built a small following in a niched market of Ruby on Rails developers. I only ever entered this market because I decided to publish what I learned publicly. I stumbled into it all by accident.</p>
<p>Some time later after riding wave and influx of subscribers I was able to capitalize on the audience I built with a course called <a href="https://hellorails.io">Hello Rails</a>. It was my first substancial success with building and selling something online.</p>
<h3 id="staying-on-course">Staying on course</h3>
<p>Recently, I took a 4 month long hiatus from producing content. I suffered from burn out and ultimately wanted my time back.</p>
<p>I brainstormed if it was worth continuing to serve a market where I&rsquo;m more of an outlier. I have to assume being a product designer by trade doesn&rsquo;t always give Ruby/Rails developers enough trust in me. I can understand that if you want to learn from the best.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s tempting to build products outside of the niche I&rsquo;m recognized in, that means I need to basically start over in some regard. Having an audience isn&rsquo;t everything but when it comes to content, it&rsquo;s pretty necessary. I do plan to serve other markets but I already have validation from this one. Defining this market was an accident but to remove myself from it is a mistake.</p>
<p>My hope is to keep serving the market I&rsquo;m targeting with a new up and coming SaaS project. The goal with it is to help Ruby on Rails developers move more swiftly as they create and scale new apps.</p>
<p>While building this project I plan to keep creating content on my blog and YouTube channel to help scale the audience and compound returns later on. Over time I hope to build a little side business I&rsquo;m passionate about working on and one people value.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for what lies ahead. I just hope the minimal time I have allows me to get there as soon as possible.</p>
