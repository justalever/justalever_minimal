        <h1>Productizing Yourself</h1>

    </header><p>A recent trend I&rsquo;ve seen on Twitter and the Indiehacker space is the concept of productizing yourself and trying to scale this up to an unbearable scale for a solo or duo team.</p>
<p>Designers, developers, writers, etc&hellip; are thinking more about offering their services in a SaaS-like model that might be more attractive to their customers. It seems a little too good to be true and in these types of cases, I&rsquo;ve always found it to be as such. That said, can it work? Absolutely.</p>
<p>A long time ago I quit my W-2 job and started a design agency with my wife. We were a one-stop-shop for small businesses that needed marketing and branding. Our clients were generally small businesses.</p>
<p>Making our services <em>automatic</em> was a big goal of mine so we could take on more without doing all the selling in between. Often when one project ends we&rsquo;d need to go hunt or sell to find another. It was annoying and income was inconsistent as a result.</p>
<p>At one point I spent a ton of time developing an idea of &ldquo;productizing&rdquo; our services so our clients could effectively be on retainer for a monthly fee.</p>
<p><img src="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/justalever/pricing.jpg" alt="pricing"></p>
<p>We had tiers with different offerings across each and a pricing model that on paper seemed pretty awesome. Unfortunately, it never caught on. We landed most clients on a per-project basis which was easier from both sides&rsquo; perspectives.</p>
<p>I think if your brand is large enough you could start to offer these types of services as a product. I think we just weren&rsquo;t there yet and needed to either shift to more of a &ldquo;product&rdquo; in our marketing or ditch the concept entirely which is what we did.</p>
<h3 id="unlimited-revisions-are-a-mirage">Unlimited revisions are a mirage</h3>
<p>Our model wasn&rsquo;t necessarily to offer unlimited anything but it&rsquo;s a big problem of offering services as a product. I see this trend with other folks in the industry now. They offer unlimited service for a monthly rate. This seems awesome at first but I think quality ultimately suffers over time and at scale.</p>
<p>People subscribing to the productized service want to know what they are paying and how often with a subscription. They also don&rsquo;t want a cookie-cutter solution to their problems.</p>
<p>Around Twitter, I&rsquo;ve been seeing the model of &ldquo;unlimited everything&rdquo; for a flat monthly fee. I&rsquo;d argue this is fine for a small subset of clients but when you scale, <em>you</em> become a bottleneck unless your team can scale along with demand. Quality has no choice but to suffer when this happens.</p>
<p>I see too many businesses approaching the concept of scale by thinking they can just offer the same thing for everyone. The whole concept of SaaS is one-to-many but I think that&rsquo;s a bit of a fallacy when it comes to services.</p>
<p>Even in the software space, you&rsquo;ll have customers that need some hand-holding or special features toggled on or off. Things get complex fast.</p>
<h3 id="product-design-as-a-service-pdaas">Product design as a service (PDaaS)</h3>
<p>Recently I thought about opening up a product design service on a SaaS model. It would be niched heavily in the web app space. I could hire a mobile app designer and maybe a webflow/marketing page designer. I&rsquo;d manage the business and fill in the gaps. It could be cool.</p>
<p>It would also require constant grinding. I&rsquo;m in my 30s now so I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m up for that. Maybe a decade ago I would be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think you need attention for this to truly work and make bank. Becoming a semi-celebrity on Twitter or YouTube is how this model truly sees big scale/profits. Anyone can deploy the same tactics but you have to be real with yourself that if it gets too busy you&rsquo;ll need a way to adapt and grow or to exit gracefully.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a spark to try it soon.</p>
