    </header><p>If you eliminate distractions, technology, and people you are left with little to do. This is what I&rsquo;d call being bored.</p>
<p>Being bored is a true test. This state of being gives you time to think, meditate, and sit with yourself. When you aren&rsquo;t actively seeking this state it becomes painful on our patience and demanor.</p>
<p>This period is hard since we are used to being over stimulated.</p>
<p>In a world where we have access to almost any information in a few taps on a screen it&rsquo;s no wonder many of us can&rsquo;t take being bored for too long.</p>
<h3 id="creative-resets">Creative resets</h3>
<p>I find bouts of boredom are good for creativity. Taking a step back and removing myself from the day-to-day gives my mind a break. This helps me take on new tasks with an open mind rather than dragging through them.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing energy and attention on something I&rsquo;m left with ample energy in a space that doesn&rsquo;t require it.</p>
<p>Some might call this a state of insanity while others might called it an incubator of new ideas. I&rsquo;ve experienced both.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m bored I lack patience but understand what it takes to remain content. I&rsquo;ll tend to think of fond memories, ways to grow as a professional, new adventures I&rsquo;d like to try, and more.</p>
<p>Through these thoughts I tend to attach myself to something that stands out and work out a way to put more focus on it. This could be anything from relationships to earning more money.</p>
<p>Introducing chunks of time to give your brain a rest is the true underlining benefit. Instead of running laps with your mind you get to sit on the bench for a bit while the world does its thing. That seems quite healthy and something I want to enjoy more.</p>
<p>Boredom has the wrong stigma.</p>
