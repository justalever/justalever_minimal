    </header><p>Over a decade ago, I lost my mother to cancer, which significantly changed my life.</p>
<p>Before that major event, my life was incredibly great. I was young, having fun, and had a wonderful family and parents that supported anything I wanted to do (fun fact: I once tried to be a professional guitarist).</p>
<p>In those trying times, I picked up a drinking habit to cope. When you&rsquo;re grieving, you turn anywhere for some relief; unfortunately, my family and I indulged quite a bit.</p>
<p>My family has historically bonded through drinking. I don&rsquo;t know why it is, but I often wish it wasn&rsquo;t the case. I think many families and friends do this, and it&rsquo;s wild how normal it is to put toxins into our bodies until we can&rsquo;t think straight.</p>
<p>All this is to say that I&rsquo;ve struggled to quit alcohol for the past decade. I would always find a reason or excuse to pour another drink, but deep down, I hated the bad habit I&rsquo;d formed. Some might call this alcholism, and I agree, but I&rsquo;ve quit bad habits before, and I&rsquo;m finally looking to do this.</p>
<p>Alcohol provides zero benefits to humans when you think about it. It&rsquo;s expensive, makes you feel and act wrong, and doesn&rsquo;t improve life. I&rsquo;ve got a ways to go to be where I want. I struggle with energy, depression, anxiety, and the whole deck of cards, but most days, I try to be active, meditate, and be thankful for what I have. One day at a time, one foot in front of the other, one more rep, no matter the obstacle, I will keep going as it just gets better.</p>
