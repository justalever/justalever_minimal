    </header><p>In the maker community one of the most inspirational builders is a mostly anonymous person known as <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn">aj</a></strong>. Aj has worked in the web design/development space for years <a href="https://aj.lkn.io/">designing and building HTML templates for sale</a>. That work led to AJ creating a single page site builder called <a href="https://carrd.co/">Carrd</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday (Jan 31,2022), Aj posted an update that Carrd is now hosting <a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn/status/1488173679502667778">4.1 million sites</a>. That accomplishment as a <em>nearly</em> solo shop is remarkable. It got me wondering what I would feel like in that position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built a lot of websites and apps but none that truly scaled past millions of users. I&rsquo;ve worked on apps that have scaled to nearly a million users and when you put that into perspective compared to 4.1 million it&rsquo;s really wild.</p>
<p>Putting myself in those shoes, I assume to get to that scale you&rsquo;ve seen your fair share of shit. Server issues, site bugs, DDOS attacks, domain bugs, unreal customer support requests, you get the idea&hellip;</p>
<p>I mentioned to AJ on Twitter that there&rsquo;s probably a book or two worth of knowledge he&rsquo;s learned over the years. In response he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If only I was coherent enough to articulate it all”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That response leads me to believe there is just so much to unpack on his journey so far that it would take forever to communicate accurately.</p>
<p>Makers and entrepreneurs go through this kind of stuff (often alone) and have to find their way through a very complex maze.</p>
<p>There are no predefined paths through so you&rsquo;re stuck flying by the seat of your pants often. Those that get lucky enough to see it through probably wanted to quit so many times but I imagine seeing a thing you created make such an impact, lights a fire under your ass.</p>
<h2 id="is-a-solo-maker-the-new-thing">Is a solo maker the new &ldquo;thing&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big bet but I predict more makers will start to approach doing the work in a more individualized way. What used to take teams to do now can be done by a solo creator if they are pretty savvy. Sure there may be times where they need help but hiring a team is likely the last plan of attack for most. You can contract individuals temporarily and still yield great progress.</p>
<p>We also now have the technology and resources to spin up services that auto-scale, meet consumer demand, and have near zero down time. This is achievable with a few clicks where years ago it took actually provisioning your own servers in a garage somewhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see this trend as many things we use today are monopolized by bigger tech giants and corporations. Giving society more pieces of the pot is a great way to keep the economy booming and innovation at large.</p>
<p>With web3 on the forefront, more and more services will be come decentralized which benefits all parties. Not having a centralized source allows everyone involved to benefit and not just those at the top on board seats. It&rsquo;s a new way to build that still needs to work its kinks out but I&rsquo;m excited to see a new wave of tech enter the scene.</p>
<p>The maker community is inspiring to say the least. I&rsquo;ve dabbled myself and failed many times so far but I&rsquo;m determined to keep trying. So far I&rsquo;ve built and sunset the following:</p>
<h4 id="content">Content</h4>
<ul>
<li>Web-Crunch - A blog for devs and designers with an accompanying YouTube channel.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="digital-products">Digital Products</h4>
<ul>
<li>Book - &ldquo;pro tumblr theming&rdquo;</li>
<li>Book - &ldquo;LUXD: Learn User Experience Design&rdquo;</li>
<li>Course - <a href="https://hellorails.io">Hello Rails</a> - Most success so far</li>
<li>Course - Hello HTML &amp; CSS - Never saw the light of day</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="saas">SaaS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Affinity Designer, Photo, and Publisher screencasts as a service - Launched, got a couple customers, sunset due to lack of time/energy to keep creating content as a service.</li>
<li>Asynchronous Team Communication app - Like an unbundled basecamp with messages, teams, and todos. Launched but never got enough traction. Marketing wasn&rsquo;t a focus where it should have been from the start.</li>
<li>Podcast hosting SaaS - A community driven podcast hosting service. Never saw the light of day but impressed myself building it.</li>
<li>Freelance job board - A job board for freelance based jobs. No full-time roles. Had some decent traction but ultimately didn&rsquo;t stick with it long enough/wanted to keep pursuing.</li>
<li>Developer network for Ruby on Rails devs - I was building this in public on YouTube. I suffered from burn out and eventually sold the domain (railsdevs.com). Another developer picked it up and is doing something similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>What a long journey it has been. Maybe I&rsquo;ll make a product grave yard soon to show that building shit is hard. Seeing any bit of success is quite lucky and if you do be sure to count your blessings!</p>
